# Expense Tracker

![App preview](src/Preview.png)

Basic expense tracker that counts your incomes and expenses. I also used [recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) library.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### For this project I have used these technologies:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/)


## How to start

#### Intall [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Download project

#### In root directory run
```
npm install
```
#### Run project
```
npm start
```

## How to use
Select income or expense in first input. Then select what kind of expense or income it will be. Enter amount in dollars and date when you spent selected expense.
Tracker will automatically count your incomes and expenses and will show your balance.
